    <h3 class="m0">Why we built it</h3>
    <p class="m0">
      Clinics juggle charts, calendars, and staff assignments daily. Spreadsheet
      and paper workflows slow everyone down. Health Jam lets teams update
      records once and trust the entire clinic sees the change instantly.

    <h3 class="m0">Who it helps</h3>
    <p class="m0">
      Receptionists book appointments, nurses update patient status, and
      administrators oversee access. Every role has a tailored workspace without
      extra clicks.

    <h3 class="m0">How it works</h3>
    <p class="m0">
      Log in, search for a patient or physician, and schedule the visit.
      Dashboards show upcoming appointments, and account controls ensure only
      the right people make critical changes.
